# Questions

3. Comment of the frequency of exits
   Answer: Frequency of the exits depends on the system use.The number of exit increases as more priveleged operations are performed.
      ![image](https://github.com/aishwaryaravi19/linux/blob/master/output-assignment2/q3.png)
       
4.Of the exit types defined in the SDM, which are the most frequent? Least?

Answer:  Most frequent exit - MSR_WRITE(count -605825)
         Least frequent exit - DR_ACCESS(count-8)

   ## Question 3
     * Comment of the frequency axis
       Frequency of the time spent depends on the type of exit.The number of exits tends to increase if more proveleged operations are performed by the system
